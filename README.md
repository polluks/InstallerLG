# InstallerLG

A re-implementation of the LISP-like 'Installer' scripting language included
with AmigaOS as of version 2.1. InstallerLG aims to be fully compatible with
the original as described in the V43.3 documentation. Most of the resource
related limitations of the Commodore implementation are gone and the GUI has
been replaced by a MUI / Zune based one.
